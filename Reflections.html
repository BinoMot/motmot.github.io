     <h2>Reflections</h2>
	
    <p> <b>What are your remarkable experiences in science class this quarter?</b> The extra activities were very fun to do and I learned from it in addition to normal lectures. The lessons were very interesting because most of them had useful knowledge that I may be able to use in the future such as making a website or form.</p>

	<p> <b>What challenges/difficulties have you encountered in science class this quarter?</b>  In Performance Task 1 I had a difficult time making a webpage because it was my first time writing code and html.</p>
	
	<p> <b>How did you resolve the challenges/difficulties that you had?</b> I solved this  by experimenting with the html tags and attributes and asked help from my classmates and used  my notes.</p>

	<p> <b>What lessons have you learned that you can apply in your life based on the solutions that you had in resolving those challenges?</b> One should try first and never give up as one  cannot get better if one does not try.</p>
